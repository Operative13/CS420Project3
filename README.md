# Tic-Tac-Toe

Class project where the goal is to create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe playable against an AI. The AI is implemented using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning. 

## How to play
1. Compile all the .java files (just Main.java should be fine though)
2. Run the program through Main.java
3. Follow the program statements and allow the program to run until prompted to enter your next move.
   1. You will need to enter how much time (in seconds) to give the A.I. to 'think'.
4. To save a game, simply enter "save" during your move and name the saved file.
5. To load a game, simply enter the name of the saved file at the beginning of the main menu.
6. To quit a game, enter "quit" during your move.
